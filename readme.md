 A [touhoulittlemaid](https://github.com/TartaricAcid/TouhouLittleMaid) addon mod, is designed to teach maids how to use other mods for cooking and farming.

## Notice
  - Due to the author's personal reasons, the development progress will be extremely slow (maybe the pit will be abandoned...)
  - If you want to play as soon as possible, you can click `Star` and find the latest version of the auto-build on the [Releases](https://github.com/Wall-ev/TouhouLittleMaidAddon/releases) page
  - If you download the auto-build version ,you need to make backups before playing to avoid losing your property.
  - This project might be abandoned at any time, so if you're up for it (if you can handle this mess - it's really bad...), you can take over this project.
